        <h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Sedyavanthuala Venkata Ahalya, a dedicated 
            computer science student pursuing my degree at G.Pulla Reddy Engineering College, Kurnool.
             I'm passionate about technology and fascinated by the 
             endless possibilities it offers for innovation and problem-solving. 
             My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation 
             in computer science fundamentals, including data structures, algorithms,
              and programming languages such as Python, Java, and C. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand 
              my knowledge and skills, whether through coursework, personal projects, or internships. Outside of academics, I enjoy participating in hackathons, contributing to open-source projects, 
              and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in technology. 
              I'm excited about the prospect of applying my skills to real-world 
              challenges and making a 
            meaningful impact in the field of computer science.</p>

                Calorie burnt prediction models can help individuals
                 track their energy expenditure more accurately, 
                 monitor their fitness goals, and make informed 
                 decisions about their
